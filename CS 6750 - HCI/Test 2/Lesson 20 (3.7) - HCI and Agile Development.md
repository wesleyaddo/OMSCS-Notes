# 3.7 - HCI and Agile Development

In this lesson we will cover how we might use agile development methods to engage in quicker feedback cycles.

## The Demand For Rapid Hci

Before, costs for development, distribution, and feedback regarding software and products were expensive compared to now.

How do we take the principles we have covered so far and apply them to a rapid agile development process?

## When To Go Agile

We can make the decision to go agile by considering the following:

|                   | Traditional | Agile      |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Criticality is... | High        | Low        |
| Requirements is.. | Rarely      | Frequently |
| Team size is...   | Large       | Small      |
| Team embraces...  | Order       | Change     |

## Agile HCI In The Design Life Cycle

Agile development techniques don't replace the design life cycle, they just change the rate at which we go through it and the types of prototypes and evaluation that we actually do. We're still going to do the initial need-finding step.
