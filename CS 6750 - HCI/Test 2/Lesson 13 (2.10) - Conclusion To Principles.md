# 2.10 - Conclusion to Principles

In this lesson we will attempt to tie together all the different threads on design principles.

## Zooming Out: Human As Processor

At the narrowest level, we might view HCI as the interaction between a person and an interface. This view is shared by models such as the _GOMS model_.

## Zooming Out: Human As Predictor

Most of the time we are viewing HCI as the user interacting through some interface to accomplish some task. At this level we can look interactions in terms of the _gulf of execution and evaluation_. We can use tools like _cognitive task analysis_ and _hierarchical task analysis_ to understand things like user's mental models, errors, and mappings between representations and the underlying tasks.

## Zooming Out: Human As Participant

At the highest level, we are interested in how interactions occurs beyond just the individual, interface, and task. At this level we can look at interactions in terms of _activity theory_ where interactions include elements of the context surrounding the task. We could also look at how artifacts combine to accomplish a task through _distributed cognition_. Other times we can look at deeply understanding the situated context in which a person is acting through _situated action_. Additionally, we could also look at how users integrate through norms and relations with _social cognition_. There are times where we should keep in mind the intended and unintended positive and negative changes our designs might have on society during design.

## 5 Tips: On-Screen UI Design

1. Use a grid
2. Use a whitespace
3. Know your Gestalt principles
4. Reduce clutter
5. Design in grey-scale

## Only Half of the Picture

We have a lot of principles and frameworks to help us design good interfaces but that is only half of the picture. To create truly great user interfaces we must also understand our user as well as the fact that we are not our user.

### Reflections: HCI Principles

_Reflect on the interfaces you use that have disappeared between you and the task. Focus especially on the interfaces that were never visible in the first place, not interfaces that became invisible by learning. Which of the principles we've discussed do you now see at play in the design of some of those interfaces_?

When I first used the Apple iTouch music player there was something very different and intuitive about it. First, I was able to directly manipulate the interface and click on buttons which had the affordance of a button on a digital screen. Second, the interface would actively give me feedback through clicking such that I could easily perceive that I am actively accomplishing my task.

### Design Challenge: Designing Audio-books For Exercisers

_Revisit the audio-book design challenge. Start thinking narrowly about the physical interactions between Morgan and the interface and then zoom out to her interactions with the task as a whole, then zoom out even further to how the interaction between Morgan and the interface relates to other things going on in the world around her. Lastly, think about how interfaces like this have the potential to effect society itself_.

At the processor level, the interface should allow Morgan to easily be able to accomplish her tasks quickly and efficiently and there should not be many steps for her to accomplish her task when using the audio-book app during exercise. At the predictor level, the interface should allow Morgan easily use and learn the interface as the interface should match her mental model through use of designs consistent with other similar applications and application structure. At the participant model, the interface should allow Morgan to distribute cognitive tasks such as remembering exercise schedules, progress, workouts, etc. by serving as an artifact through distributed cognition. Additionally, the audio-book application should support social cognition by allowing Morgan to share her progress through the application. This has the potential to reduce obesity in society by encouraging people to work out.
